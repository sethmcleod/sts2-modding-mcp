## Automated Playtesting and Debugging

### Full Game Automation

The bridge can control every screen in the game:

- **Start seeded runs** with specific characters, ascension levels, modifiers, and fixture commands that pre-configure relics, cards, gold, and powers
- **Play cards** with targeting, **end turns**, **use/discard potions**
- **Navigate maps** by row/column, **make event choices**, **claim rewards**, **buy from shops**, **choose rest site actions**, **pick treasure**, and **select/skip/confirm cards**
- **Execute console commands** (gold, godmode, add relics/cards, force fights, heal, etc.)
- **Manipulate state** — set HP/gold/energy, draw cards, add powers/relics mid-run
- **Set game speed** from 0.1x to 20x for fast-forwarding through animations
- **Capture screenshots** at any point for visual verification

## Game Asset Extraction (GDRE Tools)

These tools use [GDRE Tools](https://github.com/GDRETools/gdsdecomp) to reverse-engineer the Godot side of the game — the `SlayTheSpire2.pck` archive containing 15,000+ scenes, textures, resources, scripts, and audio files.
