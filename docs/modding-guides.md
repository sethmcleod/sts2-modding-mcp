# Modding Guides (29 Topics)

The `get_modding_guide` tool provides built-in documentation on these topics. Topics marked with **new** were derived from patterns found across the community mod ecosystem.

> **A note on guides:** MCPs like this live and die on how up-to-date and well-written the modding guides and references are. It will eventually figure things out with self-debugging, but adding to this database is key to being more efficient. **If you use it for a project, please have it write out additional guides and push them to the repo!**
