# Troubleshooting

## Setup Issues

### "Decompiled source not found"
The `decompiled/` directory is empty or missing. Run:
```bash
ilspycmd -p -o ./decompiled "<game_dir>/data_sts2_windows_x86_64/sts2.dll"
```
Or use the `decompile_game` tool after connecting the MCP.

If `ilspycmd` isn't found: `dotnet tool install -g ilspycmd`

### "sts2.dll not found"
The `STS2_GAME_DIR` environment variable points to the wrong location, or the game isn't installed.
Default path: `E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Slay the Spire 2`

Check: `<game_dir>/data_sts2_windows_x86_64/sts2.dll` should exist.

### "dotnet CLI not found"
Install .NET SDK 9.0 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

### Server won't start or connect
1. Check Python version: `python --version` (needs 3.11+)
2. Check dependencies are installed: `pip install .` (from the project root)
3. Test directly: `python run.py` — should start without errors
4. Check your `.mcp.json` or `settings.json` path is correct (use forward slashes)

## Build Issues

### "Build failed — assembly reference errors"
The mod can't find sts2.dll. Set the `STS2_GAME_DIR` environment variable to your game install path, or pass it to dotnet build:
```bash
dotnet build /p:Sts2GameDir="/path/to/Slay the Spire 2"
```
The csproj auto-detects the platform-specific data subfolder (`data_sts2_windows_x86_64`, `data_sts2_linuxbsd_x86_64`, `data_sts2_macos_arm64`). The resolved path must contain `sts2.dll`.

### "Type or namespace not found"
Common causes:
- Missing `using` statement — check the generated code's imports
- Wrong .NET target — must be `net9.0`
- Missing NuGet packages — run `dotnet restore`
- BaseLib reference missing — add `<PackageReference Include="Alchyr.Sts2.BaseLib" Version="0.1.*" />`
- **Wrong BaseLib namespace** — The NuGet package is `Alchyr.Sts2.BaseLib` but the C# namespaces are `BaseLib.Abstracts`, `BaseLib.Utils`, `BaseLib.Cards`, etc. Do NOT use `using Alchyr.Sts2.BaseLib.*;`
- **PoolAttribute not found** — `[Pool]` is in `using BaseLib.Utils;`, NOT in `BaseLib.Abstracts`

### "Model must be marked with a PoolAttribute"
Runtime error during game startup. Every `CustomCardModel`, `CustomRelicModel`, and `CustomPotionModel` needs a `[Pool(typeof(...))]` attribute. This includes curse cards (`CurseCardPool`) and status cards (`StatusCardPool`). Add `using BaseLib.Utils;` for the attribute.

### "ModelNotFoundException: Model id=POWER.MYMOD-MY_POWER not found"
A power failed to register during ModelDb initialization. Common causes:
- Constructor threw an exception (check log above this error for the root cause)
- A cascading failure from another model's registration error (fix the first error first)
- Invalid property override (e.g., wrong `PowerStackType` or `PowerType` enum value)

Valid `PowerStackType` values: `None`, `Counter`, `Single`

### "Hook method signature mismatch"
The game updated and a hook's parameters changed. Use:
```
get_hook_signature "HookName"
```
to get the current signature, then update your override.

### "EnableDynamicLoading not set"
Your `.csproj` must include:
```xml
<EnableDynamicLoading>true</EnableDynamicLoading>
```
Without this, the game can't load the mod DLL.

## In-Game Issues

### Mod doesn't appear in the mod list
1. Check `mods/<modname>/mod_manifest.json` exists and is valid JSON
2. Required manifest keys: `id`, `name`, `author`, `version`, `has_dll`
3. The DLL filename must match what `has_dll` expects
4. Check the Godot log for load errors

### Mod loads but content doesn't appear
- **Cards/relics/potions:** Check `[Pool(typeof(PoolName))]` attribute is present
- **Monsters:** Check `generate_create_visuals_patch` was applied
- **Encounters:** Check the act encounter patch was applied
- **Events:** Events need a patch to add them to an act's event pool
- **Modifiers:** Need the registration patch on `ModelDb.get_GoodModifiers`/`get_BadModifiers`
- **Localization:** Check JSON files are in `<ModName>/localization/eng/` and `has_pck: true` in manifest

### Godot scene scripts not found / "Script not found" errors
If you create `.tscn` scenes in Godot that attach C# scripts from your mod, you must register your assembly with Godot's script bridge during mod initialization:
```csharp
public static void Initialize()
{
    var assembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
    Godot.Bridge.ScriptManagerBridge.LookupScriptsInAssembly(assembly);

    Harmony harmony = new(ModId);
    harmony.PatchAll();
}
```
Without this, Godot won't find your mod's script classes when instantiating scenes.

### Null reference exception in hooks
- Models must be accessed after initialization — don't read `ModelDb` in static constructors
- `Owner` may be null if the entity isn't attached to a player yet
- `CombatManager.Instance` is null outside of combat
- Always null-check `player.PlayerCombatState` — it doesn't exist outside combat

### Compendium scroll stutters / `CanonicalModelException`
Description/tooltip render code that reads `Owner` (or otherwise asserts mutability) throws
`CanonicalModelException` when the game renders a **canonical (immutable) model** — the copies
that back the card library / compendium. Because the compendium re-renders every visible card
**every frame** while scrolling, the exception fires continuously (capturing a stack trace each
time), which tanks the framerate and can cascade into layout `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` errors.

Guard any `Owner`-dependent preview by short-circuiting on `AbstractModel.IsMutable` first — a
live preview is only meaningful on a mutable combat instance anyway:
```csharp
// Canonical compendium models throw if you touch Owner; only build the
// live preview on a mutable (in-combat) instance.
description.Add("FormulaDamage",
    IsMutable && FormulaDamagePreview is { } d ? $" ([green]{d}[/green])" : "");
```
Symptom in the Godot log: repeated `CanonicalModelException ... used in incorrect place` under
`_Process(delta)` while the compendium is open.

### PCK not loading
- `pck_name` in manifest must match the actual `.pck` filename (without extension)
- `has_pck` must be `true` in manifest
- The PCK must be in the same directory as the manifest

## Bridge Issues

### "Bridge not running"
- Game must be open AND past the loading screen
- MCPTest mod must be installed and enabled
- Only one game instance can use port 21337

### "Bridge timed out"
- Game may be loading or in a transition
- State queries run on the main thread — if the game is stuck, so is the bridge
- Try `bridge_ping` first

### "Unknown method" from bridge
- The C# BridgeHandler doesn't have a handler for this method
- This means the bridge mod needs updating (rebuild test_mod)

### Actions don't work
- Check `bridge_get_screen` — you might be on the wrong screen
- Check `bridge_get_available_actions` — the action might not be legal
- Combat actions only work during `COMBAT_PLAYER_TURN`
- Map navigation only works on `MAP` screen

### Card plays silently fail (card stays in hand)
If `PlayCardAction` fails silently, the card remains in the player's hand at the same index. Common causes:
- **Wrong targeting**: Self-targeting cards (Defend, Powers) passed with an enemy target — check `card.TargetType` before resolving targets
- **Star cost not checked**: Regent cards with star costs may report `CanPlay() == true` but fail at play time — manually check `PlayerCombatState.Stars >= starCost`
- **Action executor stalled**: A previous action is still running — call `WaitForActionExecutor()` before queueing new actions

### Potion targeting issues
Self-targeting potions (Flex Potion, Fortifier) must always target the player's creature, regardless of any enemy target provided. Check `potion.TargetType` first:
- `Self` / `TargetedNoCreature` → always target `player.Creature`
- `AnyEnemy` → use the selected enemy target
- `None` / `All` → target is null (game handles)

### Async deadlocks during EndTurn or enemy actions
`Task.Yield()` and `Cmd.Wait()` can cause deadlocks when async continuations don't complete. See the `advanced_harmony` guide for patterns to suppress yields during critical sections and patch `Cmd.Wait()` for testing/headless contexts.

## Common API Gotchas

### No MagicVar class
The game has no `MagicVar`. For generic numeric values, use a named `DynamicVar`:
```csharp
new DynamicVar("Amount", 3m)       // access via DynamicVars["Amount"]
new DynamicVar("HitCount", 4m)     // access via DynamicVars["HitCount"]
```
Named vars used by the game: `DamageVar`, `BlockVar`, `HealVar`, `HpLossVar`, `EnergyVar`, `CardsVar`, `PowerVar<T>`.

### No Scry in STS2
Unlike STS1, there is no Scry mechanic or `CardPileCmd.Scry` method. Cards that "look at the top of the deck" need alternative implementations.

### Creature.CurrentHp is read-only
Use `CreatureCmd.SetCurrentHp()`, `CreatureCmd.Heal()`, or `CreatureCmd.LoseHp()` instead of assigning directly.

### RelicRarity enum
Values: `None`, `Starter`, `Common`, `Uncommon`, `Rare`, `Shop`, `Event`, `Ancient`. There is no `Boss` — use `Ancient` for boss-tier relics.

### PowerStackType enum
Values: `None`, `Counter`, `Single`. There is no `IntensityThenDuration`.

### GainBlock signature
```csharp
CreatureCmd.GainBlock(Creature creature, decimal amount, ValueProp props, CardPlay? cardPlay, bool fast = false)
CreatureCmd.GainBlock(Creature creature, BlockVar blockVar, CardPlay? cardPlay, bool fast = false)
```

### CreatureCmd.Damage ambiguity
The last parameter can be either `CardModel?` or `Creature?`. Disambiguate with a cast:
```csharp
await CreatureCmd.Damage(ctx, creature, 5m, ValueProp.Unblockable, (CardModel?)null);
```

### Player.MaxHp doesn't exist
Use `player.Creature.MaxHp` instead.

### CardEnergyCost properties
Use `EnergyCost.GetWithModifiers(CostModifiers.None)` to read cost. Use `EnergyCost.SetThisTurnOrUntilPlayed(0)` to set a card to cost 0 this turn.

## Common Code Patterns

### Async methods without await
If your hook method is `async Task` but doesn't use `await`, add:
```csharp
await Task.CompletedTask;
```
Or remove the `async` keyword and return `Task.CompletedTask`.

### Flash() not showing
`Flash()` only works on relics and powers that are attached to a player in combat.
Make sure `Owner` is set and combat is in progress.

### Console commands not working
- The console is enabled automatically when any mod is loaded
- Command IDs use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `BURNING_BLOOD` not `BurningBlood`)
- Use `get_console_commands` to see the full command list with argument formats

## Log Locations

- **Godot log:** `%APPDATA%/Godot/app_userdata/Slay the Spire 2/logs/godot.log`
- **Mod log:** Check in-game console output or the Godot log
- **MCPTest bridge log:** Written to Godot log with `[MCPTest]` prefix
- **Settings:** `%APPDATA%/Godot/app_userdata/Slay the Spire 2/settings.save`
- **Save files:** `%APPDATA%/Godot/app_userdata/Slay the Spire 2/saves/`
